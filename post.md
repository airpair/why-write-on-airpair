Posting on Airpair takes time. It takes effort. And it's sometimes very intimidating when you haven't posting your ideas on the internet before. What can make it even scarier is that at AirPair we set the bar even higher. For content to be available for public viewing, it must receive 3 reviews with a better than average rating to qualify. So why even go through all the trouble to write a post your content on AirPair?

<h2> The People You Meet </h2> 
One of the best ways to meet great developers is to start publishing posts on AirPair. That's because there are plenty of developers who enjoy reviewing each other's posts and may even end up reviewing yours. While you may be worried about anxious about putting your ideas out to your peers, there is no need to worry! Developers on AirPair are respectful, courteous people who give positive, constructive feedback on the website. We are an understanding community. When you post, there's never a risk of your reputation being harmed as we take respect very seriously on our website.

Oftentimes, when your post is reviewed, a developer may suggest an idea or an application of your ideas that you hadn't thought of in the past. This may motivate you two to connect further, cultivating a relationship based on mutual interests and discovery. Great relationships have started on AirPair because of the empathy authors have for one another. 

Business partners, customer relationships, and great friendships can be formed on AirPair because it's an environment of learning, acceptance, discovery, and a love for technology. In its rawest form, technology simply means finding ways of doing things better than they have been done in the past. Developers on AirPair are passionate about finding new ways to make developers lives easier and get their code unstuck. 

<h2> The People That Meet You </h2>

One of the most interesting things about the modern age is how many people meet us on the internet who we never know about. One of the great benefits of being published on AirPair is your name will be seen  by a highly qualified network of business owners, developers, managers, and professionals who use the site. This means that a post you may not think twice about may end up landing you a job in the future. 

One of the biggest signs of credibility is what other people think about you in your industry. Since all your posts require 3 backers to be publicly consumed, you are given enourmous respect if your post is published on the site. This shows to your potential employer or customer that you're serious about your work and know how to contribute. Even more importantly, your peers respect you. 

This also shows to potential business owners who may be looking for a partner to work on a project with how creative you are in your endeavors. We often underestimate our abilities and don't market ourselves well to the global community. By writing on AirPair, you're essentially making yourself known in a genuine, human way without having to sell yourself like a 24/7 networker would. The beauty of being on an online platform like this is most of the people who contact you after reading your post will have already screened you out as someone they genuinely want to meet. We don't personally give out emails for privacy reasons but there are many ways you may meet someone interesting in the future. 

 <h2> Collaboration </h2> 
 <img src="https://airpair.github.io/img/2015/02/social-authoring-header.png">
AirPair simulates a professional, online hackathon with developers each working on their own projects and posting their ideas independently onto one platform. This allows for collaboration unheard of in the past in the sense that you can find developers who fit what you're interested in just seconds by selecting which technology tag you want to search. You can also create joint posts with other authors and collaborate in a multitude of ways. The best thing about this is the developers are pre-screened for being genuine, human individuals who are qualified. 

AirPair is also a fantastic place to solicit for collaboration as it is pre-screened as a network for highly talented developers. 

 <h2> Get Discovered </h2>

AirPair allows you to get discovered by premier sponsnors who are looking for developers to write about how they use their technology. The developer competition brings together a wide range of innovative technology companies who are interested in how developers are using their products. The ones above are just a few of the names we have! There are a number of prizes for the winners and the sponsor list is growing each day. There are more than 20 $500 prizes and an overall prize of $5000. Don't miss out on your chance to show your cool stuff to these companies!

<h2> Explain your skill-set </h2> 
Many developers on our website have fantastic skills that companies are just dying to use. Heck you probably have a few activities that you do for fun that you could get paid for!

By writing on AirPair, you clearly explain what you enjoy doing so you can get more work that you enjoy doing. By no means are you obligated to help a company that is interested in pairing with you. But what's the hurt of putting yourself out there? You might find an opportunity that you haven't even thought about. 

<h2> What you should do </h2> 

To get involved, start simple. Give out a review to a post on the website and we'll enter you into a raffle for a free t-shirt.

This is a way to showcase your AirPair pride and your belief that pair-programming is in our future. The braces on the left corner of the shirt represent collaboration on a whole new level. That's what social authoring is about on our website; that's what AirPairing is about; and that's what our community is about. We strongly believe that two heads (or more) can sometimes be better than one and we are committed to spreading this belief. 

While developers working in isolation can be very productive, we believe that social developing needs to be integrated just as much if not more so than isolated developing.

Even though there are numerous studies talking about the productivity of pair programming, it is still relatively ignored by much of the world because of its difficulty of implementation. We're committed to changing that perception. But why is pair programming so important?  

Pair programming not only produces fantastic code but also facilitates beautiful, sponatenous, and natural human connection. By enabling people to work together in a previously isolating field, pair programming allows for genuine human connection in a profession that caused loneliness sometimes for the more extroverted programmers. While some developers readily enjoy working alone, others feel the need to interact with others in their work day and isolated programming deprives them of that need. That can lead to unhappiness. While pair programming shouldn't be implemented everywhere, it should be considered everywhere. 

So get that review done. It will be a symbolic support of the social and collaborative nature of programming and you may win a T-shirt. What's the downside in that?

When you have reviewed a post, please submit yourself to the raffle by tweeting to us at @airpair saying you have reviewed a post with a link to the post that you reviewed and a few words you said about it. 

Thanks! - Tyler
